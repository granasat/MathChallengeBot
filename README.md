# Thermal ESC/POS Ticket Printing Library

The Thermal Library implements lots of commands according to the ESC/POS standard:

- Start the serial connection with the printer
- Format text: emphasis, underline, align, character size, text rotation, inverted colors (white text and black background).
- Change between small or standard font size
- Resize and print bitmaps given as a arbitrary image format (JPEG,PNG...)

Here you can find two sample programs which use the Thermal Library:
- A preview generator: preview.py
- A sample printing program: ThermalPhoto.py
